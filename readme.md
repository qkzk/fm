## Platform

Linux is the only supported platform. It may be usable on MacOS but I can't be sure.

## Video

![fm](https://github.com/qkzk/fm/blob/v0.1.23-dev/fm.gif?raw=true)

## Installation

```sh
cargo install fm-tui --locked
```

## Usage

Start it from command line with no parameters :

```sh
fm
```

or with a path :

```sh
fm -p ~/Downloads
```

If you added the [recommanded function](#cd-on-quit) to your bashrc/zshrc, simply use `f` and you will cd to the last visited directory when exiting.

## Features

Some features depends on external programs to keep fm from being really bloated.
I try to implement every feature I can think of.

### Session

Display settings (use two panes, display metadata, use second pane as preview) are saved and restored when restarting the application.

### Navigation

- Navigate with the arrows or the mouse (left select, right open, wheel)
  Basic vim keys are supported by default: hjkl, gG, Ctrl+U Ctrl+D, JK
- Open a file with o, enter or right click
- Execute a file with a custom command with e

### Moving

Many ways to jump somewhere :

- Alt+g: type the full address (with completion enabled),
- Ctrl+g: a predefined shortcut (default root folders, home and mount points, gitroot, config folder),
- Alt+j: by jumping to a flagged file,
- ': by creating your own marks and jumping to them

### File manipulation

- Flag files with `space` (\*: flag all, v: reverse, u: unflag)
- Copy / move / symlinks / delete / trash flagged files with c, p, s, x, X
- Create files, directory, rename with n, d, r
- Flag a bunch of file, change panel with TAB and move/copy them !
- Open the trash with Alt+o. x to remove permanently, enter to restore. Wipe the trash with Alt+x.
- Rename or create a bunch of file with alt-b. Flag files, alt-b, edit the names and save the file. The renaming is done.
  You can create nested files with `a/b/c` which will create every intermediate folder if needed.

### Shell

- Open a new shell in this directory with s
- Start a configured TUI application with alt-s (like htop, ncdu etc.)
- Start a configured CLI application with alt-i (like diff, dragon-drop etc.)
- Execute a shell command with '!'. Expansions (%e ext, %n filename, %s filepath, %f flagged files, %d current directory) are supported.
  pipes and redirections aren't supported.

### Display

- Change display, removing details with E or display a single pane with Alt+d
- Preview most of files (text, highlighted code, binary, pdf, exif details, image/video, audio details, archives, MS-office & OpenOffice documents) with P
- Toggle the tree view with t. Fold selected folder with z. Unfold every folder with Z, fold every folder with Alt+z.
- Enter preview mode with Alt+P. Every file is previewed in the second pane.
- Filter the view (by extension, name, directory only, all files) with F
- Find files with / (with completion: Tab, enter to search),
- flag files matching a regex with w

### Fuzzy finders

- Ctrl-f : search in filenames and move there,
- Ctrl-s : search for a line in file content and move there,
- H : display a searchable help, search for a keybinding and execute the action.

We use a fork of [skim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim), an fzf clone written in rust.

### Neovim filepicker

When you open a file with i, it will send an event to Neovim and open it in a new buffer.

As long as Neovim is runnging, it should always work, even outside of neovim.

The RPC server address is found by looking for neovim in /proc. If it fails, we can still look for an
environment variable set by neovim itself.
Finally, it's also possible to pass the RPC server address with `fm -s address`.

### cd on quit

When leaving fm, it prints the last visited path.
If you add this function to your `zshrc` / `bashrc`, it will listen to stdout and cd to the last dir.

```bash
function f() {
  fm $@
  dest=$(cat /tmp/fm_output.txt)
  if [[ -n $dest ]]; then
    cd "$dest"
  fi
}
```

For fish users, this is the function to add to your `config.fish`

```fish
function f
  # start the fm filemanager, enabling cd on quit.
  fm $argv
  set dest (cat /tmp/fm_output.txt)
  if not test -z $dest
    cd $dest
  end
end
```

### Archives

- Decompress an archive by opening it (o, enter, right click)
- Compress flagged files with C. Pick the desired algorithm from a menu.

### Custom binds

You can bind any _unbound_ key to a shell command.

- pipe & redirections (| > >> <) aren't supported !
- the first word you type is the executable. Don't start your command with environment variables, it won't work.

Expansions :

- %e : extension
- %s : selected file (full path)
- %f : flagged files (full path)
- %n : selected filename
- %d : current directory

### Logging

With `-l` or `--log`, logs are enabled. They are disabled by default.

Critical actions will be logged to `~/.config/fm/log/fm.log` and actions affecting the file tree will be logged to `~/.config/fm/log/action_logger.log`.

The last action is displayed at the bottom of the screen and can be read with `Alt+l` like a preview.
Those logs can be seen even if logging is disabled, it just won't be up to date.

### Google Drive

With the help of the amazing [OpenDal](https://opendal.apache.org/) library from Apache, you can access your remote GoogleDrive files within fm.

You must setup a client id and a client secret first. Once it's done, the helper `fm --cloudconfig` will create the configuration file for you.
It uses a refresh token which will automatically be refreshed for you by OpenDal.

Open the Cloud menu with Shift-Alt-C and pick a valid config file.
Once done, you can navigate your files with the arrow keys, download them with Return, upload the selected file with u, Delete a remote file with X (no confirmation !) and create a new directory with d.

You can setup many google drive accounts but only one can be opened at once. Use `l` to _leave_ the current one and select another one.

This is an advanced user feature with rough edges.

#### Initial setup

You need to provide credentials to access a google drive account. The only way to get them is to create a project in Google Cloud and share the credentials.

1. Open google cloud console and setup a new project for fm
2. Add the google drive API for your project with the scopes `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` and create credentials
3. Add a tester with the same email account
4. Add OAuth 2.0 credentials and copy the client id and client secret.
5. Publish your application. It changes nothing but make the refresh tokens last longer.
6. Run the helper `fm --cloudconfig` and provide the requested informations.

More infos about credentials can be found in the [rclone](https://rclone.org/drive/#making-your-own-client-id) documentation.

#### Multiple files having the same name

For some reason, GoogleDrive allows multiple files to have exactly the same name. ATM it crashes OpenDal in _testing mode_ and those files are ignored in _release_ mode.
Only developpers of fm should be concerned.

#### Notes

- This feature is still in beta and is subject to change a lot.
- Be careful with your files.
- A lot of GoogleDrive features aren't supported yet, mostly because I couldn't test them. If you want to sync your files in Linux, you should take a look at [rclone](https://rclone.org/).
- OpenDal provides a [lot of services](https://docs.rs/opendal/latest/opendal/services/index.html), not only GoogleDrive. If you want more services like that, open an issue and I'll take a look.

### More

- Copy a filename/filepath to clipboard with Ctrl+n, Ctrl+p
- Detect removable disks automatically and jump to them in a few keystrokes (Ctrl+g, up, enter)
- Drag and drop files (requires dragon-drop installed) with D
- Open and mount encrypted devices. Open the menu with Shift+e, mount with m, unmount with u.
- Set the selected image as wallpaper with W.
- Enter "command mode" with ':'. Type the name of a command and it will be executed.
- Mount a remote filesystem using ssfhs with Alt-r.
- Mount a MTP device with Alt-R.

Most of those features are inspired by ranger and alternatives (Midnight commander, nnn, lf etc.), the look and feel by dired.

## Configuration

Every configuration file is saved in `~/.config/fm/`

You can configure :

- **Keybindings**. Some should be left as they are, but all keybindings can be configured.
  use the provided config file as a default.
  Multiple keys can be bound the the same action.
- **Custom actions**. You can bind any key to a shell command.
  - don't use pipes or redirectons, they won't be parsed correctly
  - use an unset bind
  - %s is expanded to the selected path, %f is expanded to the flagged files (full paths).
  - See the [config](./config_files/fm/config.yaml) or an example.
- **Openers**. fm tries to be smart and open some files with a standard program.
  You can change that and use whatever installed program you want. Specify if it
  requires a shell to be run (like neovim) or not (like subl).
- **Marks**. Users can save about 100 differents marks to jump to, they're saved
  in your marks.config file. It's easier to let fm manage your marks, but if
  you made a mess or want to start over, simply delete the file or a single line.
- **TUI applications**. Some classic TUI applications like htop, glances, btop, lazygit are already there.
  Open the menu with `S` and pick the desired one. It will only work with a TUI application like HTOP,
  not a CLI application like bat.
- **Colors** of files.
  Non standard files (directory, char devices, block devices, symlinks, sockets, fifo) have their own configurable colors.
  You can use ansi colors or rgb values.
  Standard files are colored by their extension and you can use any gradient between two colors
  Every extension has its own random color.

## External dependencies

Most of the openers and tui applications are configurable from config files. Some are hardcoded if their command is quite specific or if I couldn't find a workaround.

## Contribution

Any help is appreciated.

I comment everything I do in [dev.md](development.md).

It's my first "published" program, so don't get upset by the code quality.
