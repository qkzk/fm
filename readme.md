  2. Add this to .zshrc :

     ```bash
     function f() {
       dest=$(fm $@)
       if [[ ! -z $dest ]]
       then

- [ ] display / event separation. use async and message passing between coroutines
- [ ] preview images @ranger [ueberzug-rs](https://github.com/Adit-Chauhan/Ueberzug-rs) @[termimage](https://rawcdn.githack.com/nabijaczleweli/termimage/doc/termimage/index.html)

## Won't do

### auto stuff

All of this stuff can be done easily through a shell command or automatically. I'm not sure I wan't to bloat fm with it.

- [ ] auto mount usb keys ??? [rusb](https://github.com/a1ien/rusb) -- just use udiskie (started automatically) and udiskie-umount /mount/point
      just use udiskie
- [ ] mtp... but fast [libmtp.rs](https://docs.rs/libmtp-rs/0.7.7/libmtp_rs/)
- [ ] connexion to remote servers [removefs](https://crates.io/crates/remotefs) [termscp](https://crates.io/crates/termscp)

  - ssh
  - sftp
  - ftp
  - google drive

  or just use sshfs...

## BUGS

- [ ] when opening a file with rifle opener into nvim and closing, the terminal hangs
