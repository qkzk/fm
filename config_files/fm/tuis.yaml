# Here you can configure which Terminal User Interface application you want to 
# be able to load from the application itself.
# Each application should be reachable from your `$PATH`.
# The `cwd` boolean, which is required must be set to true
# if the application requires a working directory, like `lazygit`.
# It can be set to false for applications that don't care about where
# they're started from, like `htop`.
