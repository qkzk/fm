    The user can search from next element with f.

- Header (path, filename), Footer (other informations).
- Every window can be clicked. Header, Footer, Files, Menus. Selectable element from menu can be clicked.
- Integrated a lot of commands into `TuiApplications` or `CliApplications`.
- Session for display settings. Settings are saved after each modification.
- Better (?) keybindings. Alt+char open a menu whose name starts with this char.
- Refactoring `lib`. Moved file to a few folders, separated display from status.
- Many bug fixes

#### Changelog

- [x] refactor term manager. Separate content construction from drawing.
- [x] better messages when asking a password
- [x] FIX: trash is buggy. Can't delete definitely. Display is wrong when empty.
- [x] FIX: cursor is off by one in password

- [x] FIX: NVIM listen address won't update if neovim is restarted while fm is still running
- [x] FIX: next is wrong when folded.
      Needs a lot of change. Can't fix everything. ATM if a childnode is folded, unfolding also unfolds every child.
      IDK how to avoid that without rewriting everything.

      We need to do next on node until we reach a displayed node. It's not good.

- [x] separate display_modes completely. Normal -> lsl (?), Tree, Preview.
      PathContent is only used in Normal and should be associated with it.
      Reseting display should switch back to user setted display.
      Preview isn't like Normal & Tree since it doesn't display files at all.

- [x] prevent logging the same file multiple times. Massive change which requires a new lazystatic element
- [x] regroup commands in one place
- [x] FIX: clicking outside above files crashes
- [x] Clickable first line. Each first line element can be clicked, resulting in an action

- [x] Clickable layout
  - [x] 1 row : address & file
  - [x] 50% or 100% : files

  - [x] last row : infos with fixed sizes
- [x] Session with display settings like [felix](https://github.com/kyoheiu/felix/blob/main/src/session.rs)
  - [x] display settings aren't read from args or config file except for "display all".
  - [x] read (using serde_yaml) and write (using serde::Serialize) display settings from a [session file](~/.config/fm/session.yaml).
  - [x] make every session element private, ensure we read the correct setting for dual.
- [x] FIX: opening help or fuzzyfindhelp crashes if a listed action has no keybind (aka. the user overwritten a keybind without creating one for old action).
- [x] !command & cli_application print the command run and the output
- [x] Pre release
  - [x] Fix last missing items
  - [x] check installation (remove config, cargo build)
  - [x] readme
  - [x] describe what was done succintly

### Version 0.1.25

#### Summary

- Improve scrolling in tree mode.
- Bulk & normal rename: create intermediate folders when renaming.
- Bulk now asks a confirmation before execution.
- Scroll to selection when opening a menu. Selected file should alway be displayed in top window.
- Scroll completion & navigation menus.
- Configurable cli applications. See `~/fm/cli.yaml`
- Simplify tui config files. Remove `cwd` boolean parameter. Doesn't break old config files.
- Display the number of entries as the size of a directory instead of '-'. Might affect performance for very large directories.
- Enable logging with `-l` or `--log`. **Nothing is logged anywhere without this flag.**
- FIX: Tree mode. Unfolding a directory unfold its children
- BREAKING: Use specific argument read from config file to run a command at startup for most common terminal emulators.
  It allows the user to setup a specific terminal unknown to me and use it with fm.
  To make this work, it will require the user to update its config file by copying the last part: "terminal_emulator_flags:..."
- FIX: entering an inaccessible dir or writing in any way to a readonly dir shouldn't crash the app anymore...
- Display & Update separation. Use a thread for display, allowing 30 fps. It uses more CPU :(
  This feature is subject to change in future versions.
- Flagged display mode. Enter with <F> and show all your flagged files. You can rename, open, trash, delete, bulk rename, open, open with etc.
  Custom and simple search (filename containing input).
  Jump to the file with <return>
  ATM both "edit::jump" and "display::flagged" show the same content. The former may be removed soon.
- Configurable menu colors. Every color used on screen is now configurable like file colors.

### Version 0.1.26

#### Summary

- BREAKING: removed jump mode completeley.
  You can see your flagged files in the display::flagged mode, default bind: <F>.
- BREAKING: removed all MOCP controls from fm. What was it doing there anyway ?.
  Those change won't break your config file. While building the application, line with reference to removed binds will be erased.
- search with regex. You can search (Char('/')) a regex pattern. Search next (Char('f')) will use that regex.
- left or right aligned and clickable elements in header
- shift+up, shift+down while typing something cycle trough previous entries.
  Those are filtered: while typing a path, suggestions are limited to previous pathes, not previous commands.
- shift+left erases the whole input line
- wrap tuikit::event into custom event. Use an mpsc to request refresh and bulk execution.
  While editing filenames in bulk, the application isn't bloked anymore.
- improve neovim filepicking. While ran from a neovim terminal emulator, use the flag `--neovim`. Every _text_ file will be opened directly in current neovim session.
  Watchout, if you try to open text & non text files at the same time, it will run a new terminal with your text editor instead. Don't mix file kinds.
- Dynamic filtering while typing a filter
- Search as you type: do / then type a pattern and you will jump to the match.
- replace `tar tvf` by `bsdtar -v --list --file`. Which can preview .deb and .rpm files
- preview torrent files with `transmission-show`
- preview mark, shortcut & history content in second pane while navigating
- zoxide integration. While typing a path in "Goto mode" (default keybind "alt+g"), the first proposition will come from your zoxide answers.

### Version 0.1.30

#### Summary

- shell & exec menu allow %t as terminal expansion. It allows you to open a file in a new terminal.
  `! %t nvim %s` will open the selected file with neovim in a new terminal.
- cd command (Alt+g) includes children of a path (detected as soon as you type a /)
- double clic on a menu item to execute it. Same as a clic then press enter.
- Fixed a bug where search completion would be made before the char is inserted, displaying wrong results
- Fixed a bug where preview were built for second pane even if it wasn't visible, wasting ressources
- Move as you type. In Cd menu (Alt+g), the display and preview is updated as you type.
  Pressing Esc (leave mode) go back to where you started from.
  You need to validate with enter.
- Sync left tab from right path shift+left. shift+right go the other way.
- A lot of refactoring:
  - flagged files,
  - input history,
  - application start, main loop & quit,
  - display
  - menus
- Fixed a bug where leaving a menu while a tree is displayed resets the index.

### Version 0.1.31

#### Summary

- tuikit is replaced by crossterm & ratatui.
- skim is replaced by nucleo.

  tuikit and other crates created by the same author aren't maintened anymore.
  fm relied a lot on the work of a single author: terminal events, rendering,
  fuzzy finding, parsing of ANSI output etc. were all written by the same developper
  and it created a lot of technology debt.

  Maintaing this code required to fork some repositories which was a lot of work and could create more debt if someone took the project further.

  It's been a pleasure to work with those crates but I believe it's the right move.

  By switching to maintened crates we ensure to be able to evolve the project
  more safely.

  Most of the code is adapted "as is". I did my best to keep everything as it was
  and don't break anything.

  The fuzzy finder looks really different but all its rendering is now much simpler.

- double click is replaced by middleclick. Less intuitive but much more convenient in crossterm.
- redirection in shell commands.

  You can enter a shell command by typing `!` then `ps -ef | grep %s` and see the if the selection is beeing executed.
  It allows you to execute complex shell commands and see their output.

  Expansion haven't change (%s selection, %p current path, %n filename, %e extension, %f flagegd files, %t terminal emulator)
  Strings like `echo "Hello World"` or `echo 'Hello World'` should be processed correctly.
  Tokens like `*` and shorcuts like `~` are recognized and dealt by sh.
  Most environment variables aren't known since it's a new shell which run the command. You can still do `!` `export a=2; echo $a` and see... `2` on the output.
  It also works for sudo commands : `sudo ls %s | grep pattern` will ask a password and execute `sudo ls your/selected/path | grep pattern`.

  There's a lot of steps and it's surelly buggy, I'll have to simplify it as much as possible in a future version.
  The interface won't change, the internal will surelly do.
  Since this parser is used everywhere, it means you can define custom commands with redirections. I can't think of an usage but may be you will !

- Bugfixes:
  - FIX: trash: bottom line is wrong "Enter" doesn't select but restore - refresh & reselect
  - FIX: input_simple: when height is low, static elements are out of the window
  - FIX: crash when deleting a file in tree mode
  - FIX: diplay directory last line shouldn't be printed - erase the last line before printing log.
  - FIX: Alt+c (open config file) should be betterly logged
  - FIX: shortcut. dedup_slow keeps crashing. Sort unstable + dedup will do the trick.
  - FIX: second pane ueberzub 1 char too left

### Version 0.1.32

#### Summary

- print on quit doesn't work anymore in bash / zsh and surelly in fish also (not tested.)

  I tried to make environement variables to work but couldn't.
  The alternative uses a temporary file :

  Put this in your bashrc / zshrc and use it as you did already.

  ```sh
  function f() {
    fm $@
    dest=$(cat /tmp/fm_output.txt)
    if [[ -n $dest ]]; then
      cd "$dest"
    fi
  }
  ```

- case insentive search.

  - A lowercase pattern matches regardless of case
  - An uppercase pattern will match regarding case.

  search for "car", it will find "Cargo", "cargo", "Car".

  search for "Car", it will find "Cargo", "Car" but won't match "cargo"

- new expansion for shell commands: %c expands into the clipboard content.
  Haven't found an usage yet but I couldn't live without it.
  It's the same as `!`, `some_command <Ctrl+v>`
- chmod improvment. Enter "chmod" mode with "+" or "alt+m"
  - you can type a permission in octal mode (like 640), litterally (like rwxrwxrwx) or like in chmod "a+x", "-w" etc.
- Temporary marks. Use Char(") and Alt+" to jump and save. Only 10 are saved so we can index with the digits.
  Those marks aren't saved on disk and are dropped when the application stops.
- Use the current window when possible.
  - When you start a shell with `s` or open a file opened in a terminal, we use the current window instead of starting a new terminal emulator.
    It doesn't work if you open multiple files which doesn't share a common opener (like a text file and a pdf).
  - Tui application (lazygit, ncdu, btop, htop...) reuse the same window.
  - Shell commands expansion & custom commands expansion: 
    `%t` allows the command to be executed in a new shell in the same window. `%t` should always be the first argument.

- Nerdfont icons for filetypes. When metadata isn't shown, use nerdfont devicons to display the filekind.
  Association is copied from [ranger_devicons](https://github.com/alexanderjeurissen/ranger_devicons).
  Fuzzy finder of files display the same icon.
- Bugfixes:
  - Fuzzy navigation (home, end, ensure window surrounds index)

#### Changelog

- [x] navigate: home should go to first, end should go to last. g/G can't be used here since it can be a navigation
- [x] function for cd on quit doesn't capture the terminal and hangs
      Use a temporary file since I no environement variable seems to be set anywhere.

      Update the new function in readme.

  ```sh
  function f() {
    fm $@
    dest=$(cat /tmp/fm_output.txt)
    if [[ -n $dest ]]; then
      cd "$dest"
    fi
  }
  ```

- [x] chmod improvment
  - [x] "+" should enter chmod
  - [x] FIX: wrong order in display of permission, "all" was displayed before "group"
  - [x] allow octal like 777
  - [x] allow rwxrw.r.. and rwxrw-rw--
  - [x] allow a+x +x o-w etc.
  - [x] replace input by current mode when entering
- [x] display preview of flagged files in menu flagged.
- [x] preview should display how the file is previewed even if it's obvious "Previewed as binary file"
- [x] FIX: preview binary navigation goes too fast, some lines are skipped
- [x] shell_command_parser refactor. Won't do. It's clean already. I need a lexer & a parser. I couldn't use pipes or redirections, now I can.
  - [x] new shell command expansion %c current clipboard
- [x] menu / rendering / widgets
  - [x] rendering with ratatui widgets
    - [x] menu
      - [x] navigate: draw menu using ratatui widgets
    - [x] display top window
      - [x] directory
      - [x] tree
      - [x] preview:
        - [x] text
        - [x] syntaxed
        - [x] binary
        - [x] command output (ansi colored text)
    - [x] other elements
      - [x] second line
      - [x] log line
      - [x] header & footer
        - [x] create 2 ratatui line & use alignment for display

    - [x] shortcuts
    - [x] tui applications
    - [x] cli applications
    - [x] compression
    - [x] context
    - [x] input_history: too much code change
    - [x] marks

- [x] WONTDO: ratatui component for progress bar for copymove. Is very poor. I already need a thread to handle the progress, why would I replace it with something less powerful ?

  - [x] terminal should only be cleared when necessary (if we used the same window)
- [x] FIX: copy progress bar has wrong width
- [x] FIX: human size. Use 1 decimal place for files sizes 10.0. No decimal places otherwise.
      human size: 3.5G shouldn't be displayed as 3G. 12.3G should still be displayed as 12G. See [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/blob/main/src/output/render/size.rs#L79)

### Version 0.1.33 

#### Summary 

- Mount menu. All your mount points and non mounted devices in one menu (Alt+u). Select with arrows, enter to navigate to, mount with m, unmount with u.
- Reponsive display of metadata. In small windows, some metadatas (group, modified times, user etc.) are hidden. Better experience in very small windows.
- Press Shift+V to enter visual selection (directory & tree display modes). Flag files by moving up or down.
- More consistant keybinds : Alt (used to open menus) : Alt+c opens the compression menu, Shift+c opens the config file.
- iterm2 Inline Image Protocol. Compatible terminal emulators (WezTerm etc.) can use their own image displayer. 
  You can display images without having ueberzug installed.
- Copy text file content to clipbloard with Ctrl+a. Only works for "text" files guessed from their extension. 
- Removed "terminal" & "terminal flags" from configuration.  Doesn't break config file. It's just not used anymore. Shell programs are opened in the same window and doesn't require new terminal.
- removed "clips" for videos animations. It was too slow :( I'll try again someday
- VISUAL flagging like in ranger. Press V (shift + v) and flag while you move.
- swaped default keybinds between 'Compression' and 'Config file'. Compression is a menu and most of them are opened with Alt
- Use char keybinds in tuimenu & cli menus for quick actions
- Preview compiled executables with readelf
- Theming. Use custom themes for syntax highlighting.
  Themes should be stored in `~/.config/fm/syntect_themes/` and can either be .tmTheme (textmate-themes) or .themedump (compressed).
  All textmate themes should be compatible. You can find more themes here : https://github.com/filmgirl/textmate-themes 
  If anything goes wrong while loading your theme, it defaults to monokai which is hardcoded. It should never fail.
- Display inode number after size in context menu, opened with (Alt + t) or (Right Click)
- Move the cursor with a click. In menus with text input, you can click a character and move the cursor there.
- Delete a "word" to the left in input modes with Alt + Backspace.

**Bugfixes :**

- Rename: renamed file stays selected. Also, you can't overwrite an existing file anymore.
- Permissions: special bits (setuid s/S, setgid s/S, sticky t/T) wasn't displayed or parsed properly.
  - They're all displayed properly.
  - User can set complex permissions from octal (like 2755), full display (rwxrwsrw-) or a subset of chmod. 
    It's still possible to do !chmod whatever %s to change the permissions
- Files with size between 9.5units and 10.0units weren't properly aligned.
- click in menus was offset by 2
- shell would open in other tab path
- open config file did nothing
- Updated syntect to `5.2.0` since older versions required a crate which didn't compile anymore.
- Could crash if a processus was terminated between file listing and file display
- Numbered files weren't sorted "naturally". Use Natural Order.
- Focus could be lost after resizing

        - [x] Mount struct should have a builder struct with associated methods
        - [x] failed sudo commands should display the reason in "log line" : wrong passord ? command failed ? etc.
        - [x] status.dispatch_password should match against (dest, action) for simpler code
      - [x] remove RemovableDevices
    - [x] FIX: unmounting an encrypted drive doesn't reset password
    - [x] NFS & network drives
    - [x] use ratatui `Table` to display mount menu and improve alignment.
    - [x] use numeric keybinds to goto quickly

- [x] FIX: open 2 tabs, move to right, navigate in right, go left tab, shell opens in right tab path
- [x] FIX: click on menu is off by 2
- [x] FIX: substract with overflow footer
- [x] use readelf for ELF file
- [x] IMP: copy file content to clipbloard
- [x] FIX: single tab, Alt+p (preview) should open the preview instead of a second tab
- [x] FIX: sort shouldn't be reset when directory view is reset
- [x] FIX: sort, <CR> should reset but change focus
- [x] FIX: sorting should always display the selected file 
- [x] FIX: after rename selection is lost
- [x] FIX: rename shouldn't overwrite existing file
- [x] Integrate Ueberzug-rs in src. Wasn't maintened anymore.
- [x] share a common ueberzug instance for all image drawing 
  - [x] simplified ueberzug commands build
  - [x] where to attach it ? Display itself. 
  - [x] how to call it ? as deep as possible, from Ueber inside preview
  - [x] problem: where to store the last modified image ? it should be stored in ueberzug itself... Doing so delegates the clearing to ueberzug itself. 
  - [x] FIX: preview, quit preview, doesn't erease.
  - [x] display should draw the ueberzug image itself
- [x] refactor disk_space without using internal_settings.disks.collect as often
- [x] FIX: ssh sessions or whatever which can't create windows should try to ...
  - [x] don't create anything image related if user hasn't x11
- [x] support other way of displaying image, sharing API : 
    Support for inline image protocol & ueberzug display of images. Detection is made at start.

   downscaling large images with fast libs instead of letting ueberzug/terminal do the hard work isn't fast.
   I should let ueberzug & wezterm do the hard work.

  - [x] ueberzug. Simplify, holds into an enum variant
  - [x] support [Inline Images protocol](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html)
    - [x] detect the terminal, default to "unable" if not comptabile nor ueberzug is available
      - wezterm : $WEZTERM_EXECUTABLE
      - warp : $WARP_HONOR_PS1  
      - tabby : TABBY_CONFIG_DIRECTORY
      - vs code : VSCODE_INJECTION
    - [x] build the string
    - [x] display the string
    - [x] clear (for each line of rect, write empty string)
    - [ ] BUG: wrong sizes for vertical images left pane has wrong size
  - [x] debugging / testing : scrolling through large directories isn't fast.
- [x] FIX: special flags in permissions aren't read or write correctly.
  ref : [wikipedia permissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions#Symbolic_notation) && [chmodcommand](https://chmodcommand.com/chmod-7755/)
  - [x] read (with or without special flags)
  - [x] write (2755, rwsrw-rw-, a+x etc. are accepted)
- [x] FIX: wrong alignment for files with size between 9.5 units and 10.0 units.
- [x] Video thumbnails were slow. No more "clip", only a static image.
- [x] updated syntect version since "onig" crate couldn't compile anymore.
- [x] theming. Use custom themes for syntax highlighting. 
  - [x] default to monokai
  - [x] parsing the config file,
  - [x] document the config file 
  - [x] load .tmTheme & .themedump 
- [x] Display inode number after size in context menu
- [x] FIX: if a processus is terminated between listing (Directory) and display, the display crashes. Removed all unecessary unwrap.
  Display empty lines for those processes.
- [x] FIX: inacessible files should be displayed normally, replace unknown by ???
- [x] FIX: numeric filenames aren't sorted properly. Use [Natural Order](https://github.com/lifthrasiir/rust-natord)
- [x] FEAT: responsive display of metadata
  - [x] responsive: group, permissions, date, owner, whole metadata
  - [x] format picker in display with separate logic
  - [x] common formaters for directory & tree
  - [x] avoid useless cost: displayed tree lines requires a second creation of fileinfo...
- [x] FEAT: click on input moves the cursor
- [x] FEAT: delete a word and to the left with alt+backspace. Stops at any "separator" (non alphanumeric ascii char)
- [x] reduce bloat without changing API
  - [x] nvim-rs : use `nvim --server adress --remote filepath` May require nvim remote or nvr.
  - [x] log4rs : use a custom logger
- [x] better logs: `date - file:line:col [function name] - content`
- [x] FIX: display could crash from substraction with overflow if width is very low
- [x] FIX: Sync left tab to right tab wasn't doing anything
- [x] FIX: 2 panes, focus right, resize to lower, right pane is closed but still has focus.
- [x] Removed useless function color_to_style

### Version 0.1.34

### Chat GPT ideas

Tell me 10 cool features a TUI file manager could have

Sure! Here are 10 cool features a TUI (Text-based User Interface) file manager
could have:

Easy navigation: A TUI file manager should allow users to navigate through
directories and files quickly and easily using keyboard shortcuts.

File previews: Users can preview the contents of a file without having to open
it. This feature can be particularly useful for large text files, images, or
videos.

Customizable interface: A TUI file manager should be customizable so that users
can choose the information they want to see on the screen, such as file size,
modification date, and file type.

File operations: Basic file operations like copying, moving, and deleting
should be easily accessible and efficient to perform.

Bulk operations: A TUI file manager should allow users to perform bulk
operations on multiple files at once, such as renaming or deleting them.

Tabbed interface: A tabbed interface allows users to have multiple directories
open at the same time, making it easy to move files between them.

Bookmarking: Users can bookmark frequently used directories for quick access.

Integrated terminal: A TUI file manager can include an integrated terminal to
execute commands without switching to another application.

Search functionality: Users can search for files based on their name, content,
or other criteria, with the search results displayed in real-time.

Cloud storage integration: TUI file managers can integrate with cloud storage
services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive, allowing users to manage
their cloud files directly from the file manager interface.
