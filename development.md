     ```

- [x] Refactor preview using a common trait & macros
- [x] fix previewing non normal file hangs by preventing previewing...
- [x] send a notification when files are copied or moved
- [x] regex matcher (w) updates as you type
- [x] help displays current keybindings
- [x] dual pane. Only two tabs
- [x] allow multiple keybindings for same action

- [x] Fix: / (slash) in newfile, newdir crashes the app with strange errors. Use sanitize_filename
- [x] goto relative path. Look for directory in current path
- [x] keeps searching for same result with f.

  When a search is made (/),

  - if the user completes (TAB) and Enter, only this file can be found.
  - if the user doesn't complete but Enter immediatly, we can find any file containing this name.

    The user can search from next element with f.

- Integrated a lot of commands into `TuiApplications` or `CliApplications`.
- Session for display settings. Settings are saved after each modification.
- Better (?) keybindings. Alt+char open a menu whose name starts with this char.

- Many bug fixes

#### Changelog

- [x] refactor term manager. Separate content construction from drawing.
- [x] better messages when asking a password
- [x] FIX: trash is buggy. Can't delete definitely. Display is wrong when empty.
- [x] FIX: cursor is off by one in password
- [x] display mode / edit mode. Separate display (normal, tree, preview) from any other mode.
- [x] FIX: NVIM listen address won't update if neovim is restarted while fm is still running
- [x] FIX: next is wrong when folded.
      Needs a lot of change. Can't fix everything. ATM if a childnode is folded, unfolding also unfolds every child.
      IDK how to avoid that without rewriting everything.

      We need to do next on node until we reach a displayed node. It's not good.

- [x] separate display_modes completely. Normal -> lsl (?), Tree, Preview.
      PathContent is only used in Normal and should be associated with it.
      Reseting display should switch back to user setted display.
      Preview isn't like Normal & Tree since it doesn't display files at all.
  - [x] move every src to a related folder
- [x] refactor regex. Allow regex match in tree
- [x] FIX: can't jump to file from tree mode
- [x] refactor chmod into its own mod
- [x] refactor node creation (file or directory) in its own mod
- [ ] refactor password.
  - [x] only one enum
- [x] FIX: browsing a file where "modified" time is in future crashes the application.
      The error comes from refresher.rs and happens with poorly configured iso files.
- [x] Fix the error itself,
- [x] log a message when we encounter such a file, since there's not much we can do
- [x] prevent logging the same file multiple times. Massive change which requires a new lazystatic element
- [x] regroup commands in one place
- [x] FIX: clicking outside above files crashes
- [x] Clickable first line. Each first line element can be clicked, resulting in an action
- [x] don't allow rename of parent or self folder (. & ..)
- [x] FIX: print on quit requires to drop everything holding a terminal
- [x] Improve refresh actions. Subfolders in tree mode are now watched.
- [x] Trait LineDisplay for EditMode
- [x] Split tree & lsl drawing into smaller methods
- [x] cargo clippy -- -D clippy::pedantic -D clippy::nursery
      1100 -> 891 errors
- [x] FIX: resizing deselects the current file.
- [x] FIX: first line use selected tab even when not selected
- [x] refactor bulk. Made it a bit simpler
- [x] status refactoring. Moved every "menu" to a separate file.
- [x] FIX: leaving edit mode doesn't refresh completion
- [x] use rc instead of owned types in fileinfo
- [x] renamed path_content to Directory
- [x] renamed Display::Normal to Display::Directory
- [x] event_dispatch refactor
- [x] refactor file opening. Far from satisfying
- [x] FIX: wrong position of cursor in edit modes. Use a cursor offset for all modes.
- [ ] merge specific commands & cli_info
  - [x] merge
  - [x] remove specific commands
- [x] don't store as much info while parsing tree content. Be as lazy as possible.
- [x] Context menu (right click, alt+t) with most common actions
- [x] unify keybindings: alt+char should be reserved to menus starting with same letter
- [x] Clickable layout
  - [x] 1 row : address & file
  - [x] 50% or 100% : files
  - [x] 50% or 0% : menu
  - [x] last row : infos with fixed sizes
- [x] Session with display settings like [felix](https://github.com/kyoheiu/felix/blob/main/src/session.rs)
  - [x] display settings aren't read from args or config file except for "display all".
  - [x] read (using serde_yaml) and write (using serde::Serialize) display settings from a [session file](~/.config/fm/session.yaml).
  - [x] make every session element private, ensure we read the correct setting for dual.
- [x] FIX: opening help or fuzzyfindhelp crashes if a listed action has no keybind (aka. the user overwritten a keybind without creating one for old action).
- [x] !command & cli_application print the command run and the output
- [x] Pre release
  - [x] Fix last missing items
  - [x] check installation (remove config, cargo build)
  - [x] readme
  - [x] describe what was done succintly
  - [x] test every mode

## Current dev

### Version 0.1.25

#### Summary

- Improve scrolling in tree mode.
- Bulk & normal rename: create intermediate folders when renaming.
- Bulk now asks a confirmation before execution.
- Scroll to selection when opening a menu. Selected file should alway be displayed.
- Scroll completion & navigation menus.
- Configurable cli applications. See `~/fm/cli.yaml`
- Simplify tui config files. Remove `cwd` boolean parameter. Doesn't break old config files.
- Display the number of entries as the size of a directory instead of '-'. Might affect performance for very large directories.
- Enable logging with `-l` or `--log`. Nothing is logged anywhere without this flag.
- FIX: Tree mode. Unfolding a directory unfold its children
- BREAKING: Use specific argument to run a command at startup for most common terminal emulators from config file.
  To make this work, it will require the user to update its config file by copying the last part: "terminal_emulator_flags:..."
- FIX: entering an inaccessible dir or writing in any way to a readonly dir shouldn't crash the app anymore...
- Display & Update separation. Use a thread for display, allowing 30 fps. It uses more CPU :(

## Won't do

### auto stuff

All of this stuff can be done easily through a shell command or automatically. I'm not sure I wan't to bloat fm with it.

- [ ] auto mount usb keys ??? just use udiskie (started automatically) and udiskie-umount /mount/point
- [ ] cloud services (apple, microsoft, google, dropbox etc.)
- [ ] ftp

### Chat GPT ideas

Tell me 10 cool features a TUI file manager could have

Sure! Here are 10 cool features a TUI (Text-based User Interface) file manager
could have:

Easy navigation: A TUI file manager should allow users to navigate through
directories and files quickly and easily using keyboard shortcuts.

File previews: Users can preview the contents of a file without having to open
it. This feature can be particularly useful for large text files, images, or
videos.

Customizable interface: A TUI file manager should be customizable so that users
can choose the information they want to see on the screen, such as file size,
modification date, and file type.

File operations: Basic file operations like copying, moving, and deleting
should be easily accessible and efficient to perform.

Bulk operations: A TUI file manager should allow users to perform bulk
operations on multiple files at once, such as renaming or deleting them.

Tabbed interface: A tabbed interface allows users to have multiple directories
open at the same time, making it easy to move files between them.

Bookmarking: Users can bookmark frequently used directories for quick access.

Integrated terminal: A TUI file manager can include an integrated terminal to
execute commands without switching to another application.

Search functionality: Users can search for files based on their name, content,
or other criteria, with the search results displayed in real-time.

Cloud storage integration: TUI file managers can integrate with cloud storage
services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive, allowing users to manage
their cloud files directly from the file manager interface.
