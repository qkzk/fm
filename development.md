  1. Install a link to `fm` in your path or copy the binary

  2. Add this to .zshrc :

     ```bash
     function f() {
       dest=$(fm $@)
       if [[ ! -z $dest ]]
       then
         cd $dest
       fi
     }
     ```

- [x] Refactor preview using a common trait & macros
- [x] fix previewing non normal file hangs by preventing previewing...
- [x] send a notification when files are copied or moved
- [x] regex matcher (w) updates as you type
- [x] help displays current keybindings
- [x] dual pane. Only two tabs
- [x] allow multiple keybindings for same action
- [x] single pane if width is low
- [x] disks:
  - [x] simplify disk space read,
  - [x] hold a sys reference in status
  - [x] add shortcut to mount points
- [x] dissociate action from status / tab
- [x] opener fallback to xdg-open, capture stderr & stdout
- [x] toggle between simple & complete output

- [x] make every key configurable
  - [x] syntax able to parse any combination of key
  - [x] config parser -> `Keybindings { binds: HashMap<Key, ActionMap>}`
  - [x] help display
  - [x] link any event to actionmap
  - [x] display every event in help
- [x] FIX. displaying marks also shows a char from previous mode at end of line. Don't add "\n"...
- [x] FIX: open, visite, go back then display history -> crash.
- [x] FIX wrong pattern in mark file caused crash. Rewrite file if wrong pattern found.
- [x] Compressed files:
  - [x] Opening a supported compressed file decompress it.
  - [x] Preview a compressed file displays its content
- [x] preview images
  - [x] display an image as a pixeled thumbnail. IDK how to integrate ueberzug-rs / ueberzug into tuikit so it's an acceptable solution. The result is ugly.
  - [x] default preview exif
  - [x] char('T') for thumbnail
- [x] togglable dual panes... with default mode for low size
- [x] FIX: non ascii typed symbols crash the application.
      Don't use non ascii chars atm. It's hard to navigate in a string of non ascii chars and
      would require another crate.
- [x] non ascii char support. ie graphemes. Simply use a vec of chars and collect it when needed.
- [x] Fix: / (slash) in newfile, newdir crashes the app with strange errors. Use sanitize_filename
- [x] goto relative path. Look for directory in current path
- [x] keeps searching for same result with f.

  When a search is made (/),

  - if the user completes (TAB) and Enter, only this file can be found.
  - if the user doesn't complete but Enter immediatly, we can find any file containing this name.

    The user can search from next element with f.

- [x] publish 0.1.0 on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/fm-tui)

  - [x] documentation
  - [x] move strings to separate file
  - [x] build script
  - [x] readme for user not developpers, move readme to dev.md
  - [x] fix dependencies (skim-qkzk instead of a git version, no wildcards, tuikit 0.4.5 for skim)
  - [x] publish on cargo

## TODO

- [ ] remote control
  - [x] filepicker
        requires the nvim-remote rust crate installed
  - [ ] listen to stdin (rcv etc.)
    - [ ] follow change directory
    - [ ] when called from a file buffer in nvim, open with this file selected
  - [ ] nvim plugin - set a serverstart with a listenaddress, send it to fm
  - https://github.com/KillTheMule/nvim-rs/blob/master/examples/basic.rs
  - https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html
  - [ ] $NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS isn't always set on nbim startup ; can be set from nvim before running... then sent to fm with some args
  - [ ] args read correctly, use NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS if args is sent
- [ ] display / event separation. use async and message passing between coroutines
- [ ] @ranger [ueberzug-rs](https://github.com/Adit-Chauhan/Ueberzug-rs) @[termimage](https://rawcdn.githack.com/nabijaczleweli/termimage/doc/termimage/index.html)

- [ ] plugins

  - which language ?
  - what for ?

- [ ] NeedConfirmation should take a parameter, avoiding an attribute in tab/status.

- [ ] Future version
  - [ ] remove references to local thing
  - [ ] translations i18n

## BUGS

- [ ] when opening a file with rifle opener into nvim and closing, the terminal hangs
- [ ] log0, log1, log2 are created by log4rs in source folder
  - [x] using absolute path, files are created in the right place
  - [ ] the default file is still `log{}` instead of `log0`...

## Won't do

### auto stuff

All of this stuff can be done easily through a shell command or automatically. I'm not sure I wan't to bloat fm with it.

- [ ] auto mount usb keys ??? [rusb](https://github.com/a1ien/rusb) -- just use udiskie (started automatically) and udiskie-umount /mount/point
      just use udiskie
- [ ] mtp... but fast [libmtp.rs](https://docs.rs/libmtp-rs/0.7.7/libmtp_rs/)
- [ ] connexion to remote servers [removefs](https://crates.io/crates/remotefs) [termscp](https://crates.io/crates/termscp)

  - ssh
  - sftp
  - ftp
  - google drive

  or just use sshfs...
