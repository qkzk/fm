    The user can search from next element with f.

- Header (path, filename), Footer (other informations).
- Every window can be clicked. Header, Footer, Files, Menus. Selectable element from menu can be clicked.
- Integrated a lot of commands into `TuiApplications` or `CliApplications`.
- Session for display settings. Settings are saved after each modification.
- Better (?) keybindings. Alt+char open a menu whose name starts with this char.
- Refactoring `lib`. Moved file to a few folders, separated display from status.
- Many bug fixes

#### Changelog

- [x] refactor term manager. Separate content construction from drawing.
- [x] better messages when asking a password
- [x] FIX: trash is buggy. Can't delete definitely. Display is wrong when empty.
- [x] FIX: cursor is off by one in password

- [x] FIX: NVIM listen address won't update if neovim is restarted while fm is still running
- [x] FIX: next is wrong when folded.
      Needs a lot of change. Can't fix everything. ATM if a childnode is folded, unfolding also unfolds every child.
      IDK how to avoid that without rewriting everything.

      We need to do next on node until we reach a displayed node. It's not good.

- [x] separate display_modes completely. Normal -> lsl (?), Tree, Preview.
      PathContent is only used in Normal and should be associated with it.
      Reseting display should switch back to user setted display.
      Preview isn't like Normal & Tree since it doesn't display files at all.

- [x] prevent logging the same file multiple times. Massive change which requires a new lazystatic element
- [x] regroup commands in one place
- [x] FIX: clicking outside above files crashes

- [x] Clickable layout
  - [x] 1 row : address & file

  - [x] 50% or 0% : menu
  - [x] last row : infos with fixed sizes
- [x] Session with display settings like [felix](https://github.com/kyoheiu/felix/blob/main/src/session.rs)
  - [x] display settings aren't read from args or config file except for "display all".
  - [x] read (using serde_yaml) and write (using serde::Serialize) display settings from a [session file](~/.config/fm/session.yaml).
  - [x] make every session element private, ensure we read the correct setting for dual.
- [x] FIX: opening help or fuzzyfindhelp crashes if a listed action has no keybind (aka. the user overwritten a keybind without creating one for old action).
- [x] !command & cli_application print the command run and the output
- [x] Pre release
  - [x] Fix last missing items
  - [x] check installation (remove config, cargo build)
  - [x] readme
  - [x] describe what was done succintly
  - [x] test every mode

### Version 0.1.25

#### Summary

- Improve scrolling in tree mode.
- Bulk & normal rename: create intermediate folders when renaming.
- Bulk now asks a confirmation before execution.
- Scroll to selection when opening a menu. Selected file should alway be displayed in top window.
- Scroll completion & navigation menus.
- Configurable cli applications. See `~/fm/cli.yaml`
- Simplify tui config files. Remove `cwd` boolean parameter. Doesn't break old config files.
- Display the number of entries as the size of a directory instead of '-'. Might affect performance for very large directories.
- Enable logging with `-l` or `--log`. **Nothing is logged anywhere without this flag.**
- FIX: Tree mode. Unfolding a directory unfold its children
- BREAKING: Use specific argument read from config file to run a command at startup for most common terminal emulators.
  It allows the user to setup a specific terminal unknown to me and use it with fm.
  To make this work, it will require the user to update its config file by copying the last part: "terminal_emulator_flags:..."
- FIX: entering an inaccessible dir or writing in any way to a readonly dir shouldn't crash the app anymore...
- Display & Update separation. Use a thread for display, allowing 30 fps. It uses more CPU :(
  This feature is subject to change in future versions.
- Flagged display mode. Enter with <F> and show all your flagged files. You can rename, open, trash, delete, bulk rename, open, open with etc.
  Custom and simple search (filename containing input).
  Jump to the file with <return>
  ATM both "edit::jump" and "display::flagged" show the same content. The former may be removed soon.
- Configurable menu colors. Every color used on screen is now configurable like file colors.

### Version 0.1.26

#### Summary

- BREAKING: removed jump mode completeley.
  You can see your flagged files in the display::flagged mode, default bind: <F>.
- BREAKING: removed all MOCP controls from fm. What was it doing there anyway ?.
  Those change won't break your config file. While building the application, line with reference to removed binds will be erased.
- search with regex. You can search (Char('/')) a regex pattern. Search next (Char('f')) will use that regex.
- left or right aligned and clickable elements in header
- shift+up, shift+down while typing something cycle trough previous entries.
  Those are filtered: while typing a path, suggestions are limited to previous pathes, not previous commands.
- shift+left erases the whole input line
- wrap tuikit::event into custom event. Use an mpsc to request refresh and bulk execution.
  While editing filenames in bulk, the application isn't bloked anymore.
- improve neovim filepicking. While ran from a neovim terminal emulator, use the flag `--neovim`. Every _text_ file will be opened directly in current neovim session.
  Watchout, if you try to open text & non text files at the same time, it will run a new terminal with your text editor instead. Don't mix file kinds.
- Dynamic filtering while typing a filter
- Search as you type: do / then type a pattern and you will jump to the match.
- replace `tar tvf` by `bsdtar -v --list --file`. Which can preview .deb and .rpm files
- preview torrent files with `transmission-show`
- preview mark, shortcut & history content in second pane while navigating
- zoxide integration. While typing a path in "Goto mode" (default keybind "alt+g"), the first proposition will come from your zoxide answers.

  - [x] preview symlink to files as the target. Must change PreviewBuilder completely
  - [ ] preview refactor
  - [ ] simplify the mess as much as possible

## TODO

- [ ] replace tuikit by ratatui + crossterm
- [ ] Focus & mouseover. Mousemove require raw terminal mode.. Requires to rewrite every event (Mousepress, mouse release etc.)
      Another motivation to switch to ratatui + crossterm.
- [ ] ideas from broot : https://dystroy.org/broot/#apply-commands-on-several-files
- [ ] floating windows ?
- [ ] rclone
- [ ] FIX: leaving flagged file should reset the window correctly. Can't reproduce...
- [ ] move as you type in Alt+g
- [ ] use the new mpsc event parser to read commands from stdin or RPC
- [ ] [opener file kind](./src/io/opener.rs): move associations to a config file
- [ ] open a shell while hiding fm, restore after leaving
- [ ] refactor & unify all shell commands
- [ ] config loading : https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/17v65j8/implement_configuration_files_without_reading_the/
- [ ] document filepicking (from my config etc.).
- [ ] avoid multiple refreshs if we edit files ourself
- [ ] remote control

  - [ ] listen to stdin (rcv etc.)
    - [ ] follow change directory
    - [ ] when called from a file buffer in nvim, open with this file selected
  - [ ] nvim plugin - set a serverstart with a listenaddress, send it to fm
  - https://github.com/KillTheMule/nvim-rs/blob/master/examples/basic.rs
  - https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html

- [ ] temporary marks
- [ ] context switch
- [ ] read events from stdin ? can't be done from tuikit. Would require another thread ?
- [ ] pushbullet ?

- [ ] update the animation

- [ ] build option to force reset of config file, warn the user at first start
- [ ] edit folder like a buffer [oil like](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim)
- [ ] allow pipe in execution

- [ ] tests
- [ ] remove references to local thing
- [ ] translations i18n
- [ ] dark/light theme, transparency etc.
- [ ] plugins

  - which language ?
  - what for ?

## Won't do

### auto stuff

All of this stuff can be done easily through a shell command or automatically. I'm not sure I wan't to bloat fm with it.

- [ ] auto mount usb keys ??? just use udiskie (started automatically) and udiskie-umount /mount/point
- [ ] cloud services (apple, microsoft, google, dropbox etc.)
- [ ] ftp

Tell me 10 cool features a TUI file manager could have

Sure! Here are 10 cool features a TUI (Text-based User Interface) file manager
could have:

Easy navigation: A TUI file manager should allow users to navigate through
directories and files quickly and easily using keyboard shortcuts.

File previews: Users can preview the contents of a file without having to open
it. This feature can be particularly useful for large text files, images, or
videos.

Customizable interface: A TUI file manager should be customizable so that users
can choose the information they want to see on the screen, such as file size,
modification date, and file type.

File operations: Basic file operations like copying, moving, and deleting
should be easily accessible and efficient to perform.

Bulk operations: A TUI file manager should allow users to perform bulk
operations on multiple files at once, such as renaming or deleting them.

Tabbed interface: A tabbed interface allows users to have multiple directories
open at the same time, making it easy to move files between them.

Bookmarking: Users can bookmark frequently used directories for quick access.

Integrated terminal: A TUI file manager can include an integrated terminal to
execute commands without switching to another application.

Search functionality: Users can search for files based on their name, content,
or other criteria, with the search results displayed in real-time.

Cloud storage integration: TUI file managers can integrate with cloud storage
services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive, allowing users to manage
their cloud files directly from the file manager interface.
