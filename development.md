     ```

- [x] Refactor preview using a common trait & macros
- [x] fix previewing non normal file hangs by preventing previewing...
- [x] send a notification when files are copied or moved
- [x] regex matcher (w) updates as you type
- [x] help displays current keybindings
- [x] dual pane. Only two tabs
- [x] allow multiple keybindings for same action
- [x] single pane if width is low
- [x] disks:
  - [x] simplify disk space read,
  - [x] hold a sys reference in status
  - [x] add shortcut to mount points
- [x] dissociate action from status / tab

- [x] togglable dual panes... with default mode for low size
- [x] FIX: non ascii typed symbols crash the application.
      Don't use non ascii chars atm. It's hard to navigate in a string of non ascii chars and
      would require another crate.
- [x] non ascii char support. ie graphemes. Simply use a vec of chars and collect it when needed.
- [x] Fix: / (slash) in newfile, newdir crashes the app with strange errors. Use sanitize_filename
- [x] goto relative path. Look for directory in current path
- [x] keeps searching for same result with f.

  When a search is made (/),

  - if the user completes (TAB) and Enter, only this file can be found.
  - if the user doesn't complete but Enter immediatly, we can find any file containing this name.

    The user can search from next element with f.

- [ ] allow pipe in execution
- [ ] refactor cryptdevice and iso_file

  - [ ] mode to handle those mounts. ATM it's all over the place...
  - [ ] allow mounting some other devices
  - [ ] list non mounted devices, list all mount points
  - [ ] act on them

- [ ] Version 0.1.50 : safety & memory usage

  - [ ] there's a memory leak somewhere
  - [ ] preview of big files (or whatever file) should only read chunk of the file,
        not the whole thing. Previewing a 5gB iso file uses up to 15gB of ram, which will crash any system.
        or should it ?
        Simple solutions:

        - only reads a buffer
        - limit to xxx filesize

- [ ] Version 0.2.0 : tests

  - [ ] tests
  - [ ] remove references to local thing
  - [ ] translations i18n

- [ ] Version 0.3.0 : dark/light theme, transparency etc.

- [ ] Version 0.4.0 : plugins

  - which language ?
  - what for ?

## BUGS

- [ ] creates $ENV{HOME} folders everywhere -
      a new version of log4rs seems to solve this, it's not deplayed to crates.io yet
- [ ] tree mode : index are offset by one

## Won't do

### auto stuff

All of this stuff can be done easily through a shell command or automatically. I'm not sure I wan't to bloat fm with it.

- [ ] auto mount usb keys ??? [rusb](https://github.com/a1ien/rusb) -- just use udiskie (started automatically) and udiskie-umount /mount/point
      just use udiskie
- [ ] mtp... but fast [libmtp.rs](https://docs.rs/libmtp-rs/0.7.7/libmtp_rs/)
- [ ] connexion to remote servers [removefs](https://crates.io/crates/remotefs) [termscp](https://crates.io/crates/termscp)

  - ssh
  - sftp
  - ftp
  - google drive

  or just use sshfs...

Tell me 10 cool features a TUI file manager could have

Sure! Here are 10 cool features a TUI (Text-based User Interface) file manager
could have:

Easy navigation: A TUI file manager should allow users to navigate through
directories and files quickly and easily using keyboard shortcuts.

File previews: Users can preview the contents of a file without having to open
it. This feature can be particularly useful for large text files, images, or
videos.

Customizable interface: A TUI file manager should be customizable so that users
can choose the information they want to see on the screen, such as file size,
modification date, and file type.

File operations: Basic file operations like copying, moving, and deleting
should be easily accessible and efficient to perform.

Bulk operations: A TUI file manager should allow users to perform bulk
operations on multiple files at once, such as renaming or deleting them.

Tabbed interface: A tabbed interface allows users to have multiple directories
open at the same time, making it easy to move files between them.

Bookmarking: Users can bookmark frequently used directories for quick access.

Integrated terminal: A TUI file manager can include an integrated terminal to
execute commands without switching to another application.

Search functionality: Users can search for files based on their name, content,
or other criteria, with the search results displayed in real-time.

Cloud storage integration: TUI file managers can integrate with cloud storage
services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive, allowing users to manage
their cloud files directly from the file manager interface.
